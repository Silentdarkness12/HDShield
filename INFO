Overview

CGI: In today's high-maintenance military forces, it is naturally understood that not every field of combat will be the one with a nice hefty chunk of cover to hide behind. Eventually, however, one of the more intrepid bright minds of the world came up with the idea to use standard cell packs to produce a field of horizontal cover that could be used by military forces to grant necessary cover for a firefight, gifting a strong tactical advantage. Several million dollars, multiple contract restarts, a number of frivolous injury lawsuits and several years later, very, very expensive prototypes of such a device were slowly trickled out to military forces. Certain individuals with far too much more money than brains also bought their way to a few units. The needs and wants of military forces and PMCs is moot and unimportant when enough money is thrown around, it turns out. Have to keep the undesirables off the front lawn. The Cover Generation Invoker represents both an innovation in combat tech, and also another example of the twisted, underhanded nature of the world's economy, where the haves and the have nots are concerned.

Upon deploying the CGI, instead of having everything around you turn into a poorly made new-age film, a horizontal wall of tiles will appear in front of you, protecting you from all attacks in a 180 degree direction, so long as you are not being attacked from behind. The field will remain until the CGI is destroyed, or the battery runs out. Be warned that there is a few seconds' warmup, to fully deploy the device, charge it up, and begin emitting the field.
